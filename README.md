`HoneyTools` provides a set of Fortran modules to easily deal with nontrivial honeycomb structures in real-space: generate the coordinates, compute all the distance shells, get direct access to logical masks for nearest and next-nearest neighbors (nth-order can be easily computed from the shell table). All this is primarily intended as a convenience to build tight-binding hamiltonians, but it can easily be exploited to work on any other lattice quantity, requiring real-space geometrical information.

## Installation as library

The library supports the Fortran Package Manager ([`fpm â‰¥ 0.9.0`](https://fpm.fortran-lang.org/en/index.html)). As such it can be built by simply invoking

```
fpm build
```

Custom compiler and flags can be easily selected via environment variables (or command line options), as

| Environment Variable | Defines               | Overridden by  |
| :------------------- | :-------------------- | :------------- |
| `FPM_FC`             | Fortran compiler path | `--compiler`   |
| `FPM_CC`             | C compiler path       | `--c-compiler` |
| `FPM_FFLAGS`         | Fortran compiler flags| `--flag`       |
| `FPM_CFLAGS`         | C compiler flags      | `--c-flag`     |
| `FPM_AR`             | Archiver path         | `--archiver`   |
| `FPM_LDFLAGS`        | Link flags            | `--link-flag`  |

System installation can then be achieved via

```
fpm install
```
which would _move_ all the modules in the `$HOME/.local/include` directory and the library file in `$HOME/.local/lib`. This should suffice to manage linking with other libraries and programs. As an example you can write a [`pkg-config`](https://people.freedesktop.org/~dbn/pkg-config-guide.html) file as

```sh
# honeytools.pc
prefix=$HOME/.local
exec_prefix=${prefix}/bin
includedir=${prefix}/include
libdir=${prefix}/lib

Name: honeytools
Description: The HoneyTools library
Version: X.Y.Z
Cflags: -I${includedir}
Libs: -L${libdir} -lHoneyTools 
```
and then load it invoking 

```sh
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=path/to/honeytools.pc:$PKG_CONFIG_PATH
```

To locally run the provided test units, just type:

```
fpm test "test_name"
```
where the "test_name" string, referring to the source filenames (without `.f90` extension) contained in the `test/` directory, can be omitted to run the test-suite as a whole. This is regularly done in our dedicated CI workflow, anyway. 

Finally, if for any reason you suspect that `fpm` is messing with incremental compilation (or especially after installing the library, which moves away the modules...), you can reset the build by running:

```
fpm clean
```

## Inclusion as `fpm` dependency

If you want to add `HoneyTools` as a dependency for your own `fpm` project just add the following lines to your `fpm.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
honeytools.git = "https://github.com/QcmPlab/HoneyTools.git"
honeytools.tag = "X.Y.Z" # choose a version among git tags
```

## Usage overview

The basic functionality is collected in the main, top-level, module, which you can include in your project as:
```fortran
use honeytools
```
It would often be accompanied by our _in-source_ plotting module, which provides ad hoc Fortran bindings to matplotlib and/or gnuplot, via the mighty [pyplot-fortran](https://github.com/jacobwilliams/pyplot-fortran) and [ogpf](https://github.com/kookma/ogpf) libraries. The basic use statement would be:
```fortran
use honeyplots, only: plot
```
Nevertheless we stress that the `honeytools` module provides all the core functionality to generate many common and not-so-common finite honeycomb structures: we have detached the plotting routines in a separated module to ensure a low dependency weight, especially in _non-sudo_ environments, where getting control on the exact version, path and configuration of `python`/`matplotlib` and `gnuplot` could easily become a hassle. 

A fairly comprehensive set of examples can be found in the project's wiki, if you are looking for an _unbelievably_ easy way to generate flakes, ribbons & stripes, islands... just [go there](https://github.com/qcmplab/HoneyTools/wiki/A.-Basic-usage:-supercells,-stripes-and-flakes,-all-out-of-the-box!) and be happy.

For more advanced usage you can instead include (a suitable subset of) the low-level modules, namely:

```fortran
use hex_coordinates
use hex_layout
use hex_geometries
use hex_neighbors
use xy_coordinates
use xy_neighbors
```

Which would provide access to the full API of the library. The usage is bound to a good understanding of the core implementation choice: the definition of special _cubic_ coordinates representing 2D hexagonal tessellations as a constrained 3D lattice. You can read extensively about the idea on this [delightful blog-post about videogame-development](https://www.redblobgames.com/grids/hexagons/), featuring fancy interactive visualizations and ---_for real_--- everything you'll ever need to understand in dept the underlying principles and the technical tricks. This package has taken profound inspiration from that article and the material it links to.: not all that is described there is actually implemented here and not all you have here is explained there but for sure I could never provide a better coverage for the background theory. So yeah, give it a look!

The wiki provides an [advanced example](https://github.com/qcmplab/HoneyTools/wiki/B.-An-advanced-example:-flake-with-random-vacancies-ðŸš€) too, though you'll find it a rather small and incomplete account of what can be done: the library is so flexible that even a _huge hexagonal island with random vacancies_ can be coded in less than 100 lines of code (declarations included!). We intend to gradually expand the advanced usage section in the wiki and welcome any contribution therein: if you use the package for anything that is not covered in the basic usage section, please consider to step forward and help documenting it.

## API documentation

The repository is configured for source-based, automated, API docs generation via [FORD](https://github.com/Fortran-FOSS-Programmers/ford), so that you can build the html files for your specific local version by running
```sh
ford docs.config
```
at the root directory of the project. Alternatively you can examine the [official docs for the latest commit on master](https://qcmplab.github.io/HoneyTools/), as generated by our continuous delivery workflow.
